## Project Manager 

This is a concept project I'm using to architect a RESTful API for an Android application of the same name.  It uses the Laravel Framework to build routes.  The Passport package is used to implement OAuth 2.0 (Password Grant Tokens) for the mobile API.  I built out a bit of a front end for desktop browsers, however the end goal is really to build an API.  There are only a few features built into the browser app, however it gives you an idea of the look and feel desired.
